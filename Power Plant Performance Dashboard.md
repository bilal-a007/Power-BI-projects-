# Power Plant Performance Dashboard


## Objective

Developed a reporting package to provide real-time insights into the performance of two power plants. Data was sourced from an MS SQL Server database, accessed via a remote connection. Power query is used for data cleaning, DAX is used to create Measure. After data cleaning, Microsoft Power BI was used to create an interactive dashboard. Key features include:


#### 1. **Energy Export to Grid**
- **Card visuals** display Net Delivered Energy and Wind Speed at user-defined intervals (Daily, Monthly, Yearly).
- A **Bar chart** highlights the electricity generated by both power plants on a monthly basis.
- **Treemaps** quickly show which months contributed most to company revenue.
- A **Donut chart** displays the proportion of energy generated by each power plant.

#### 2. **Capacity Factor Tracking**
To track the Capacity Factor of both power plants, **Gauge** and **Card visuals** provide insights into:
- Capacity Factor (Export Energy only)
- Capacity Factor (Export Energy + Non-Project Missed Volume)
  
Additionally, a custom **Measure** calculates the "Energy required to achieve Capacity Factor," displayed via a **Card visual**.

#### 3. **Wind Turbine Alarm History**
A dashboard was created to analyze the history of wind turbine alarms, enabling the identification of common alarms and corrective measures:
- A **Bar chart** highlights the frequency of different alarms by turbine.
- A **Scatter plot** enables day-wise analysis of recurring alarms.
- A **Donut chart** displays monthly alarm density.
- **Slicers** allow filtering by Year, Month, Date, and Alarm Code.

#### 4. **Preventive Maintenance Tracking**
A dashboard was designed to monitor the Maintenance Schedule, alerting when allowable maintenance hours are breached:
- Maintenance Hours for each turbine are displayed in a **Bar chart**, categorized by time intervals (daily/monthly), maintenance type (3M/6M), and turbine number.
- A **Donut chart** shows the proportion of maintenance hours by type.
- A **Treemap** highlights months with significant maintenance downtime.
- A **Gauge visual** displays total downtime hours of the power plant.

#### 5. **Financial Analysis**
A financial dashboard was created to provide insights into the company's financial performance, helping to make informed decisions and track overall financial health.

## Conclusion:
The Power BI solution successfully consolidates key performance metrics of the power plants, offering real-time insights into energy production, capacity utilization, maintenance activities, and financial performance. This comprehensive dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor operations more effectively, identify inefficiencies, and make data-driven decisions to optimize plant performance and financial outcomes.
