# Operational Performance Dashboard for Feeder Outages


## Objective

Developed a Power BI dashboard to track and compare operational performance metrics for the current year (FY-25) against the previous year (FY-24) on a daily basis. The dashboard categorizes feeder outages into faults, planned shutdowns, and unplanned shutdowns. Additionally, it provides insights into the top 5 fault types.


## Data Source & Processing:
- Data was sourced from offline `.csv` files, extracted from the company database.
- Power Query was used to append and clean the data.
- Multiple DAX measures were created to facilitate the analysis, including counts of outages, faults, planned/unplanned shutdowns, and percentage differences between the two fiscal years.


### Some of Power Query steps:

## Some of Key Measures (DAX):
- **CY Outages (FY-25)**: 
   ```DAX
   CALCULATE(COUNT('Outages FY-25'[Outage Id]), 'Outages FY-25'[HT Closing Sub Type] <> "RC/DC Operation", 'Outages FY-25'[FY] = "FY-25")
   ```

- **CY Planned Shutdowns (FY-25)**: 
   ```DAX
   CALCULATE(COUNT('Outages FY-25'[Outage Id]), 'Outages FY-25'[HT Closing Type] IN {"Grid Planned Outage", "Operation"}, 'Outages FY-25'[FY] = "FY-25")
   ```
- **CY Reasons (FY-25)**:
    ```DAX
    CALCULATE(COUNT('Outages FY-25'[HT fault reason]),  'Outages FY-25'[FY] = "FY-25")
 
- **LY Faults (FY-24)**: 
   ```DAX
   CALCULATE(COUNT('Outages FY-25'[Outage Id]), ALL('Outages FY-25'), 'Outages FY-25'[HT Closing Type] IN {"Fault", "Transient", "Non-Transient"}, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Outages FY-25'[Start date]))
   ```

- **LY Planned Shutdowns (FY-24)**: 
   ```DAX
   CALCULATE(COUNT('Outages FY-25'[Outage Id]), ALL('Outages FY-25'), 'Outages FY-25'[HT Closing Type] IN {"Grid Planned Outage", "Operation"}, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Outages FY-25'[Start date]))
   ```

- **Percentage Difference in Faults**: 
   ```DAX
   ([LY faults] - [CY outages]) / [LY faults]
   ```

## Features:
- **Day-to-day tracking**: Allows comparison of current year (CY) and last year (LY) outages, categorized by fault type, planned, and unplanned shutdowns.
- **Top 5 Faults**: Displays the most frequent faults to prioritize maintenance and resolution efforts.
- **Dynamic Filters**: Users can filter data by date, outage type, and specific time periods for more granular analysis.
- **Interactive Visuals**: Offers intuitive insights into the difference in outage frequencies and reasons between the two fiscal years.

## Conclusion:
This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of feeder outage performance across multiple dimensions. It enables stakeholders to quickly assess operational performance, identify inefficiencies, and make data-driven decisions to improve grid reliability and reduce downtime.
